# Theory Of Computation

In theoretical computer science, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with
whether and how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an
algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory, computability theory
and computational complexity theory.

Automata theory is the study of `abstract` machines (or more appropriately, abstract 'mathematical' machines or systems) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. These abstract machines are called `automata`.

This automaton consists of

- states (represented by circles),
- transitions (represented by arrows).
