# Theory Of Computation

In theoretical computer science, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with
whether and how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an
algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory, computability theory
and computational complexity theory.

Automata theory is the study of `abstract` machines (or more appropriately, abstract 'mathematical' machines or systems) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. These abstract machines are called `automata`.

This automaton consists of

- states (represented by circles),
- transitions (represented by arrows).

> Uses of Automata: compiler design and parsing.

## Formal Languages

*Languages*: The languages we consider for our discussion is an abstraction of natural languages. That is, our focus here is on formal languages that need precise and formal definitions. Programming languages belong to this category.

*Symbols*: Symbols are indivisible objects or entity that cannot be defined. That is, symbols are the atoms of the world of languages. A symbol is any single object such as a, 0, 1, #, begin, or do.

### Basics of strings

A string or word over an alphabet $\sum$ is a finite sequence of concatenated symbols of $\sum$ .

*Length of a string* : The number of symbols in a string w is called its length, denoted by |w|.

*Example* : | 011 | = 4, |11| = 2, | b | = 1

### Alphabets

*Alphabets*: An alphabet is a finite, nonempty set of symbols. The alphabet of a language is normally denoted by $\sum$.

### Closure properties of language classes

#### Kleen Star ($\sum$*)

It is an infinite set of all possible strings over all posible length over alphabet ($\sum$), `Excluding` $\lambda$

#### Kleen Positive($\sum$+)

It is an infinite set of all possible strings over all posible length over alphabet ($\sum$), `including` $\lambda$

> Where $\lambda$ is an null string.
